# Spotify Recommendation Algorithm

This repository contains the code and notebooks for a playlist recommendation algorithm developed using song data obtained from the Spotify API. The recommendation system utilizes a combination of machine learning techniques, including random forest algorithms and cosine similarity to personalize playlist suggestions based on user input.

## Project Structure

### Directories:

- **data**: Contains datasets used in the project, including "ms_testing" for model evaluation and "extracted to spotify" for extracted song data from the Spotify API.
- **eda**: Includes the exploratory data analysis notebook.
- **feature selection**: Consists of the feature selection notebook.
- **pipeline**: Contains a README file providing an overview of the project.

### Notebooks:

- **data_preprocessing.ipynb**: Notebook showcasing the data preprocessing steps.
- **exploratory_data_analysis.ipynb**: Offers insights from exploratory data analysis.
- **feature_selection.ipynb**: Details the feature selection process.
- **model_selection.ipynb**: Describes the model selection and recommendation system implementation.

## Overview

The project focuses on developing a recommendation algorithm for Spotify playlists. It starts with data extraction from the Spotify API, followed by extensive data preprocessing and exploratory analysis. The chosen features are selected using a specific process detailed in the provided notebooks.

The heart of the project lies in the "model_selection.ipynb" notebook, which demonstrates the utilization of random forest algorithms and cosine similarity to create a robust playlist recommendation system. The "pipeline" directory includes a README file offering an overview of the project structure.
